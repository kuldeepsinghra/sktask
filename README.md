# sktask

first run the service by command node emitter.js then you find a pass key on console.
replace your key in listener.js and then run listener.js. by the command node listener.js.
after that your listener.js running and message will receive on console that you are connected with  emiiter.
and then you go to your database where you get the data.
in listener.js file you need to replace pass key after <buffer.....> and dont forget to replace your database url.becuase data will save there.
i am not generating hosted link because i have no subscription for it.
you can check all the service in vs code terminal.
